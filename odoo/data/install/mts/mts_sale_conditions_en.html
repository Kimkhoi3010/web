    <p><b>1. Acceptance of General Terms and Conditions:</b> The current General Terms and Conditions apply to the entire contractual relationship regardless of the services provided, notwithstanding any contrary stipulation. Contrary terms and conditions of the client are not binding for MTS SA. In no case should a tacit agreement of MTS SA prevail. Under this clause, the client expressly waives the right to exert his own “General Terms and Conditions” in matters relating to a contract.</p>
    <p><b>2. Conclusion of the contract:</b> Orders and order confirmations may be communicated by post, fax and email. Orders must contain clear specifications regarding all details of execution. The client shall answer for the description and the clarity of his orders. The contract shall be deemed to be concluded upon receipt by the client of the order confirmation by MTS SA or upon the execution of the order. Services not included in the order confirmation shall be billed separately. In the case of an order resulting in work increase, MTS SA shall be entitled to invoicing the time spent carrying out such duties.</p>
    <p><b>3. Delivery terms:</b> The communicated delivery terms are not binding and are of an indicative nature. The delivery period starts from the order confirmation and ends once the client has advised that the object of the order has been executed. Failure to respect the delivery terms does not entitle the client to compensation or to terminate the contract.</p>
    <p><b>4. Delivery:</b> The object of the order is delivered and picked up at the facilities of MTS SA at the expense and risk of the client, packed and wrapped according to the instructions of the client and at his own expense (including shipping costs, customs, etc.). The transfer of profits and of risks shall take place on the date of delivery jointly determined by MTS SA and the client.</p>
    <p><b>5. Price:</b> The prices of MTS SA are stated in Swiss francs. If MTS SA raises or lowers its prices between the conclusion of the contract and delivery, the price to be applied is the price in force on the date of delivery. The prices are understood as net, excluding packaging and value added tax (VAT).  Incidental costs such as insurance premiums, taxes, dues, fees for permits or certificates, etc., shall be borne by the client.</p>
    <p><b>6. Terms of payment:</b> Payment should be made within 30 days starting from the date of invoice. Any delay in payment of the invoice entitles MTS SA to charge annual interests of up to 5%. The interests begin to accrue from the date when payment should have been made.</p>
    <p><b>7. Quality:</b> MTS SA guarantees that the products delivered are free of manufacturing flaws and defects in the materials. MTS SA’s percentage or other product-specific values shall be considered as estimated average values. Deviations, which despite all precautions taken during the operation, are inherent to the manufacture of a product and which in relation to the use for which the product is intended, remain in each individual case within the acceptable margin of error, are expressly reserved. The client accepts a minimum of 5% perquisites based on the aesthetic criteria established between the client and MTS SA following a pre-production of 20 processed parts. The client is committed to respect the manufacturing criteria and the material quality between the pre-production and all the subsequent orders. The products must be made of AISI 316 standard austenitic stainless steel, No. 1.4435, No. 1.4441 or AISI 904L No. 1439 according to the defined specifications. In the case of non-compliance with the material quality presented in the specifications of MTS SA, the latter reserves the right to claim compensation for the processing costs, despite the fact that the components may not comply with the criteria established initially. Welded/brazed inserts must only be applied using Ni/Cr soldering paste, type 16H. The satin finished and beaded-blasted terminations may be presented with slight aesthetic variations following treatment. This point must be the subject of a preliminary test with definition of aesthetic criteria. Should the client request MTS SA to sub-contract a final decorative DLC type treatment, MTS SA cannot guarantee any variation of colour tone in the decorative treatment from another batch processed by the manufacturer.</p>
    <p><b>8. Product warranty:</b> To the extent that reasonable tests enable the determination of the existence of defects or errors of delivery and quantity, complaints in this respect must be notified immediately and in writing to MTS SA, and for visible defects, notification must be carried out latest 10 days after receipt of the goods specifying the number of MTS SA’s delivery note. If the complaints are founded, MTS SA will remedy the defects, exchange the goods or deliver the missing part. If they cannot exchange the goods or complete the delivery wholly, MTS SA will take the goods back or agree on a reduction in price according to the choice of the buyer. The warranty agreed by MTS SA begins with the delivery and lasts for one year. The warranty services are limited in all cases either to the replacement, the repair of a faulty product or to the refund of the amount invoiced for the products which have not been replaced according to the choice of MTS SA. MTS SA will not respond to any possible costs of assembly or disassembly or to damages resulting directly or indirectly from products delivered by themselves, from their use or their possible defects. Claims for damages on the part of the client based on non-compliance due to negligence of MTS SA’s contractual or statutory obligations are excluded.</p>
    <p><b>9. Intellectual property:</b> The intangible rights to the products are the exclusive property of MTS SA. All equipment developed and designed specifically by MTS SA for the client shall remain the property of MTS SA. The purchase of products, the participation in the manufacturing or equipment costs does not in any way imply the grant of an intellectual property right or of a license.</p>
    <p><b>10. Equipment:</b> MTS SA reserves the right to invoice equipment. The equipment shall remain under control of MTS SA, even if they have been partially or totally invoiced to the client. MTS SA reserves the right to dispose freely of all its equipment which has not been used during two consecutive years, even if these have been partially or totally paid for by the client.</p>
    <p><b>11. Sub-contracting:</b> MTS SA may sub-contract the performance of its obligations under its legal and financial responsibility to auxiliaries.</p>
    <p><b>12. Termination:</b> MTS SA may at any moment terminate the contract, with or without previous notice. Any compensation for damages incurred as a result of said termination is expressly excluded.</p>
    <p><b>13. Integrity clause:</b> Any amendment to these General Terms and Conditions or to any contract to which these are applied shall be deemed null and void unless this is made in writing and endorsed by the parties. These General Terms and Conditions replace and cancel the previous agreements concluded between the parties either verbally or in writing.  In the event of ambiguity or inconsistency between these General Terms and Conditions or any other contractual document, the terms of these General Terms and Conditions shall prevail. The possible invalidity of one or the other provisions of the General Terms and Conditions does not imply the invalidity of other provisions whose independence has been proven.</p>
    <p><b>14. Applicable law, place of jurisdiction:</b> Swiss law is only applicable to the entire contractual relationship.  Any conflict must be the subject of conciliation within a period of 2 (two) months from the moment when the conciliator is appointed.  The conciliator will be determined by the parties. The conciliation shall be deemed to fail in the absence of agreement on the person of conciliation within a period of 4 (four) weeks from the notification by one of the parties to the other of his will to implement the conciliation procedure. In the absence of conciliation, the parties shall submit their dispute to an arbitration tribunal consisting of 3 (three) members where each of the parties shall designate its arbitrator and an umpire with the chairman of the arbitrational tribunal being designated by the arbitrators. The place of arbitration is the Canton of Neuchâtel. The applicable procedure is that of the Swiss Convention on arbitration or any text replacing it.</p>
