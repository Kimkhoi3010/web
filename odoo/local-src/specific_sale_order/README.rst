===============================
Depil Tech - Specifc Sale Order
===============================

This module displays cancelled quotations or sale orders in the
Sales > Sales Orders menu instead of Sales > Quotations.

Moreover, it adds a new group called 'SO back to quotation allowed' which
leaves unhidden the button 'Set to quotation' on cancelled sale orders.

Another feature is to display Subtotal and Total price on sale order lines in
the sale order form view. The Subtodal or Total price field is then displayed
in the report according to the partner's company_type.
