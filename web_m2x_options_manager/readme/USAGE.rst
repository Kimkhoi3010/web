Go to Settings > Technical > Models.

Choose the model you wish to edit, and open its form view. Go to the
"Create/Edit Options" tab, and add the fields you want to manage.

Button "Fill" will add every missing field to the options.
Button "Empty" will remove every option.

NB: if options `create` and `create_edit` are defined within a specific view's
arch, then the options defined from the Models form view will not be applied.
